## A fresh start

As a young developer, there is an excitement that comes with learning new technologies, having great ideas and feeling like anything is possible. You don't know what you don't know. Your naivate is an asset.

As was the case for myself years ago, I wanted to start writing on my own site out of an overflow from that feeling. Deep down, I had an urge to get recognition in the community. And while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, I thought it would be easy to keep that energy level as the fuel for keeping it going.

Since that time, I've started a family and worked for some pretty great companies doing great stuff. I have aged mentally and physically (39). I have started a family and grown more active with my church community. Much of my time and energy is devoted to _trying_ to maintain a healthy lifestyle outside of my career. Add to that the stresses of this world these past few years. Well, it adds up pretty quick.

As a natural response, the endless well of motivation and energy I once had has shallowed. In many ways, I feel like this is the natural progression of being a professional in any field. Sometimes, it makes me feel less adequate as a developer, like "I'm not doing _enough_!" I feel like I've lost some perspective. Maybe you have too.

### The impossible standard

As technology workers, we mostly live in a digital realm. We follow the work of the best in our field. One-on-one interactions are seldom, most likely on Twitter, if at all. Our remote coworkers feel distant. Many times, we probably don't get the professional interaction we need to maintain a healthy outlook and perspective on our careers.

If our socio-interactions are a system, an inbalance forms. We feed in the bleeding edge of what is happening in technology and who is accomplishing it, but fail to document how far we've come personally or what we've learned. Thus, our minds are prone to forget just how far we have come, subconsciously creating an impossible standard for us to live up to. We are never doing enough.

### Being content

I'm preaching to myself here. I definitely find that I've held myself to impossibly high standards to achieve at this stage in my life. I'm beginning to realize that the "slow burnout" I've experienced these past few years has been me subconsciously shaking my head in disappointment at why I haven't done _more_.

And so, with that said I'd like to say that I've fully self-diagnosed how to be content with my career in this stage in my life. I haven't! But hopefully taking a first step to be more intentional with this site, perhaps this time for right reasons, will help bridge that gap.
