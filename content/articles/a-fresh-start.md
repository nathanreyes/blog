## A fresh start

As a young developer, there is an excitement that comes with learning new technologies, having great ideas and feeling like anything is possible. You don't know what you don't know. Your naivete is an asset.

In that spirit, I wanted to start writing on my own site out of an urge to share ideas and get recognition in the community. And while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, I thought it would be easy to use that as the motivation for writing.

Since that time, I've started a family and worked for some pretty great companies doing great stuff. I have aged mentally and physically, started a family and grown more active with my local friends and community. Much of my time and energy is devoted to _trying_ to maintain a healthy lifestyle outside of my career.

As a result, the endless well of motivation and energy I once had has waned somewhat. In many ways, I feel like this is the natural progression of being a professional in any field. Sometimes, it makes me feel less adequate as a developer, like "I'm not doing _enough_!" I feel like I've lost some perspective. Maybe you have too.

### The impossible standard

As technology workers, we mostly live in a digital realm. We follow the work of the best in our field. One-on-one interactions are seldom, most likely on Twitter, if at all. Our remote coworkers feel distant. Many times, we probably don't get the professional interaction we need to maintain a healthy outlook and perspective on our careers.

Over time, an inbalance forms. We feed on the bleeding edge of what is happening in technology and who is accomplishing it, but fail to document how far we've come personally or what we've learned. Thus, our minds are prone to forget just how far we have come, subconsciously creating an impossible standard for us to live up to. It's an unsustainable cycle that leads to a slow burnout.

### Finding your own way

In processing all of this, I came to a realization that I wish I had discovered earlier, that
forming an identity based other people's opinions or your own accomplishments is an empty path that leads to pain and heartache. The mission of work shouldn't be to prove one's self to others, but simply to document the path with lessons learned along the way.

If others can learn from it, then all the better. In that vein, I hope to start fresh with no expection of what the site can become, but simply as an outlet of expression for myself, and perhaps other.
